      <h3 class="content-header">intro</h3>
      <p class="advice">GlobalSurp LLC operates as an affiliate marketplace, referring customers to third-party digital products sold through platforms like JVZoo, Tech Products, and other vendor marketplaces. This Refund Policy outlines how refunds, disputes, and customer support are handled for purchases made through our referral links.</p>
      <p class="advice">Since we do not process payments or control product delivery, all refund requests must be directed to the original vendor or platform (e.g., JVZoo, vendor’s website). By using our service, you acknowledge that GlobalSurp is not responsible for refunds, but we will assist in facilitating communication between you and the vendor when possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="content-header">Refund Eligibility:</li>
        <p class="advice">Refund eligibility depends entirely on the vendor’s terms and the platform’s policies (e.g., JVZoo’s refund rules). Generally, digital products may offer refunds under these conditions:</p>
        <li class="advice"> <span>Defective or Non-Delivery:</span>  The product was not delivered, or the download link is broken.</li>
        <li class="advice"><span>Misrepresentation:</span>  The product does not match its advertised features.</li>
        <li class="advice"> <span>Money-Back Guarantee:</span>  If the vendor explicitly offers a refund period (e.g., 30-day guarantee).</li>

      </ul>
      <p class="advice"> <span>Note:</span> Many digital products (e.g., software, eBooks, courses) have strict no-refund policies due to instant access. Always review the vendor’s refund terms before purchasing.</p>
     <h3 class="content-header">How to Request a Refund</h3>

    </li> 
  </ul>

  <h3 class="content-header"> Non-Refundable Scenarios</h3>
  <p class="advice">Refunds are usually not granted due to the following purposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="advice">Buyer’s remorse such as  "I changed my mind".</li>
    <li class="advice">Failure to use/download the product after purchase.</li>
    <li class="advice">Products explicitly labeled "No Refund" (common with software licenses).</li>
    <li class="advice">Disputes filed after the vendor’s refund window (e.g., 30 days post-purchase).</li>
  </ul>
<h3 class="content-header">Chargebacks and Fraud Prevention</h3>
 <ul><li class="advice"><span>Unjustified chargebacks:</span>  (filing with your bank without contacting the vendor first) may result in Account suspension on JVZoo/Tech platforms and Legal action by the vendor.</li>
